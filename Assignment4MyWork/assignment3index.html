              <blockquote style="width:700px" >About one third of the earth is covered with water, holding a wide variety of fish species which are very
                   different or unique from each other in terms of their body, color, sizes, habitat, behaviour, history and various 
                   other kinds of attributes in their respective living environment. In this article, my main focus will be on a 
                   specific fish species which had also been starred in an American computer-animated movie and the name of that 
                   species is Common Clownfish or Anemonefish. On scientific-basis these species are also known as Amphiprion percula.
                 There are at least 30 known species of clown fishes today. It is only a fish species with in many which make a symbiotic 
                 relationship with the sea anemone. They perform a special dance when they find their host anemone to get completely assimilated
                  with their home.

                     <h3>Physical attributes</h3>The body shape of a clown fish is oval like and compressed laterally. They usually have body
                     color ranges from bright orange to reddish-brown and three whitestrips on the head (just behind the eye), middle and tail
                      with each having fine black outlines respectivly. These fish species can grow upto the length of the 11 cm or almost 4.5 
                      inches. Their lifespan generally lasts from 3 to 10 years depending upon the conditions of their surroundings and how much
                       care they receive if they are in captivity of someone like in an aquarium.

                     and Southeast Asia.

                        <h3>Food habits</h3>These type of species are omnivores which means they eat meat and plants. They normally feed on zooplankton, algae and other parasites which can affect their host anemone.

                            Lifecycle and Reproduction habits</h3> The process of reproduction usually occur in tropical waters. Female clown
                             fish is attaracted my male clown fish through chasing, biting and extending of fins. Then they both, chasing 
                             each other, find a place which is commonly a coral reef or a piece of rock where the female fish can lay its eggs.
                              After laying of eggs, female fish goes away from that place and then the male fish is reponsible for the
                               fertilization, protection and fanning of those eggs. Eggs take 7 - 10 days to hatch depending on the temperature
                                condition of the water. When the eggs are hatched, the new born clown fishes are called Fry. These young borns 
                                are all male fishes and have to find food by their own. Then, they starts adapting to their host anemones. 
                                Usually, females are larger than male and those which are stronger than all others mate to reproduce. At times
                                 when the females dies, then these species have the abitlity to change gender and thus the most stronger male 
                                 fish change its gender to female. These species comes under the protandrous hermaphrodites.<dfn> Protandrous
                                 hermaphrodites</dfn> are the species which have to change from male sex to female sex.

                        <h3>Social System</h3>Another interesting facts about these fishes is that they form social hierarchies in 
                        their societies. Their dominance between each other depend on the which social rank they're on. If it 
                        is a young fish and enters a new anemone, then it has to face aggression by other clownfishes because
                         it will belong to the lower level of society in their terms. Moreover, mating is also based on the 
                         rank. The most strong pair reproduces more than that of their peers. The group in which these species 
                         exists is called Queue or School. For more information, you can <a style="background-color:cyan"

                           <h3>Communication</h3>These species communicate in a very unique way that is they make popping and
                              clicking sounds while conversing with each other. They make pop noise toward a smaller fish 
                              and a click toward a larger fish.

        <h1>Threats</h1>The popularity of keeping clownfish as a pet or for other purposes 
        like research has been increased a lot. These species are not endangered yet,
         but about 15 percent to 30 percent of them have been lost. Some of this is 
         done by fisherman catching and selling these fishes as pets. Another reason 
         is the "Nemo Effect". The sales of clownfishes got increased significantly 
         because of that movie. People bought those by seeing others without even 
         knowing how much care those fish species needed and how they can nurture 
         them by not having any proper training. Increasing levels of carbon dioxide 
         pollution is resulting in climate change and increasing ocean acidity which 
         is affecting the sea anemone and coral reefs. Ultimately if sea anemone and 
         coral reefs would not be there then how would the Clownfish would survive 
         because those are the paces in which these fishes live and give their eggs.

         <h1>Summary</h1>
        <p>Clownfishes are one of the unique ocean organisms in the world and  
        they have their different way of living and roles which differs according to 
        the various hierarchies in which their respective group on a single host anemone 
        is divided. Their one of the intersting features is that they have the ability to
         change their sex from male to female whenever a female which is the most dominant
          in the group dies. This help these species to grow and reproduce more of their own.</p>
