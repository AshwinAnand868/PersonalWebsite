        <p class="myPara">Hello guys, my name is Ashwin Anand. Currently, I am an international student of Seneca College in Canada and doing my Computer Programming diploma. Originally, I am from India and came in Canada for my studies. Naturally, I am very helpful, positive, honest and hardworking type of person. I am also very dedicated and I like to complete the work which I started before rather than moving further. This webpage is part of my course work and is also the first webpage which contains information about me. I hope you liked my work. Although it is a very basic, it took me much more time to complete it. Until 12th standard in my life, I did not know how to even use a computer properly, however now it is totally different and now I spend almost three-fourth of the day working on school projects, classes and learning other stuff from online. I had not any laptop during my childhood because of my fear that I would not be able to operate it. Seems funny ha-ha, but that is correct. Currently, I am trying to learn to as much as I can by doing coding, styling in workshops and assignments. If I get time then I also like to search about current projects that are in operation. Personally, my hobbies are reading, writing on a topic after knowing it up to some extent, listening to Bollywood songs, playing chess and basketball. Apart from these, my recent hobby is doing coding when I have time.

        <p class="content">If I talk about my experience of WEB222, then I can say it was very nice course for anyone who wants to learn
             about Web development from the very beginning. When it was started, I felt that it is very knowledgeable course 
             because notes provided contains details of vast varieties of topics like HTTP protocol and how the protocol sends 
             our request that is client's request to server. Then professor taught us about JavaScript in the starting (about
              first four weeks). During that period, I was able to learn some of the topics like JavaScript functions, objects,
               regular expressions, arrays, and some other things. Then after that we started learning about HTML and CSS and 
               I can say I got very good even though basic knowledge of these both topics. I learned how to put images, audio, 
               video, even maps, scripts, paragraphs, text area, labels, picture tags, caption tag and many other HTML tags and
                elements. If I say honestly, then learning JavaScript in four weeks seems a kind of difficult to me because the 
                notes contain overwhelming information about that language and I could not properly read all the information 
                (could only read main things because of other subjects), however for HTML and CSS, I was able to learn most things 
                from notes. Apart from the course contents, other reason of learning HTML and CSS nicely is because I got to
                 practice these topics like I created webpage and I did the styling and searched on Internet. Browsing on Internet
                  helped me a lot to learn about how to design better. From Assignment 3 to Final Assessment, I got practice of working
                   on these topics. Since, I feel that I could not learn all the notes of JavaScript properly, now what I have thought
                    is to read all the notes of this topic after the exams and that will help me to prepare for next semester Web courses.
                     Not only for other courses, but also for future work or job as basics are fundamental to any work. If I anyone
                      learned these topics properly and got very good knowledge and experience of working on this, then I can apply
                       for web designer or developer, full stack developer and many other professions which can help me to make a good
                        living.</p>
